Hi Abdur,
It was indeed a pleasure working with you. You are a quick learner and have the ability to get to the root of the situation for any issue. This was evident in your prompt responses to development and business partners on defect-fix retest requests.

I also appreciate the fact that you are taking charge of your career moves and moving over to a newer venture. This shows that you really live the motto “Change is the only Constant”

Good Luck in the new projects and as you say, I hope our paths cross again !!


Thanks,

As you’re already aware ‘today is my last working day at Accenture and Bank of America’. After  1.5 years of this wonderful experience, it is very difficult to say goodbye to my leads, colleagues and all my well-wishers. I feel that it is time for me to move on to new opportunities. I can only wish that my new phase in life will give me such rewarding experiences and supportive friends. Thank you so much for making my time at Bank of America Project a truly enjoyable one.

During these last 1.5 years at IVV,  you all have provided me support and through your encouragement and guidance I have been able to excel at the projects offered to me. With many of you, I have shared a unique camaraderie which I hope will continue in the years to come even though I shall not be here with the company. I would like to extend my best wishes to entire group.

Thank you again !!!

I am sure our path will cross again and we will meet again. J J

Hello All,

As most of you know ‘today is my last working day at Accenture and Bank of America’. After  1.5 years of this wonderful experience, it is very difficult to say goodbye to my leads, colleagues and all my well-wishers. I feel that it is time for me to move on to new opportunities. I can only wish that my new phase in life will give me such rewarding experiences and supportive friends. Thank you so much for making my time at Accenture a truly enjoyable one.

Thank you Sri, Basvaraj, Mukund, Praveen and everyone else at Accenture for giving me the opportunity to bring my best to work here.

Four years ago today, I walked into Facebook for the first time as an employee. Every day since has been a great honor. Facebook is truly a mission based culture. Our objective is to help make the world more open and connected. Despite the fact that we have over 1.3B people who use the product, in our minds, we have so much more work ahead of us than behind us. Work that I believe helps make the world a better place.
Facebook challenges all that I have to offer both as a business and technical leader. It is comprised of some of the most passionate, intelligent people I've had the opportunity to meet. And it is my belief, that as we grow, we are just getting better as a company. We learn from our mistakes, we learn from working together, and we encourage each other to reach beyond what we believe is possible.
I'm grateful for the opportunity to work at a company that touches so many people. I'm grateful that I have an opportunity to work with others who have so much to offer the world. I'm grateful that I have such an awesome team - a team that makes my best ideas better, and is unafraid to tell me of my worst ones. Most of all I'm excited about what lies ahead.
Thank you Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, David Ebersman, Dave Wehner and everyone else at Facebook for giving me the opportunity to bring my best to work here.
